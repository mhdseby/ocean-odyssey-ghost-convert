The coefficients are nothing but the ratios of areas or &#xA0; &#xA0; volumes for the actual hull form of the vessel compared to prisms or rectangles governed by the vessel&#x2019;s length, breadth, and draft. The length and breadth on the waterline as well as draft changes with displacement, coefficients of form also vary accordingly with displacement. Coefficients of form are used to facilitate the area and volume calculations for stability or strength analysis of the vessel.<br><br><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Block coefficient (CB)</strong><br>It is the ratio of the volume of a ship&#x2019;s underwater form to the volume of the<br>circumscribing rectangular solid.<br><br><strong>2.

From the information provided by navigation lights, one can deduce the direction of travel of other vessels and whether they are at anchor or engaged in some other activity. Vessels in vicinity will make collision avoidance decisions based on the information your lights provide. The collision regulations require navigation lights to be shown from sunset to sunrise and during periods of reduced visibility. It is important to ensure that a vessel is equipped with the required lights of the right intensity and that they are correctly mounted. Proof is required that navigation lights comply with the requirements of the Collision Regulations The rules that apply to a vessel depend on its length, type of propulsion, and the waters in which it is operating.<br><br><strong>MASTHEAD LIGHT</strong><br>&#x2018;MASTHEAD LIGHT&#x2019; means a white light placed over the fore and aft centreline of the vessel showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 225 degrees and so fixed as to show the light from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on either side of the vessel.<br><br><strong>SIDELIGHTS</strong><br>`SIDELIGHTS&#x2019; means a green light on the starboard side and a red light on the port side each showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 112.5 degrees and so fixed as to show the light from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its respective side. in a vessel of less than 20 metres in length the sidelights may be combined in one lantern carried on the fore and aft centreline of the vessel.</p><p><br><strong>STERNLIGHT</strong><br>&#x2018;STERNLIGHT&#x2019; means a white light placed as nearly as practicable at the stern showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 135 degrees and so fixed as to show the light 67.5 degrees from right aft on each side of the vessel.</p><p><br><strong>TOWING LIGHT</strong><br>&apos;TOWING LIGHT&#x2019; means a yellow light having the same characteristics as the<br>&apos;sternlight&#x2019;.</p><p><br><strong>ALL-ROUND LIGHT</strong><br>&apos;ALL-ROUND LIGHT&#x2019; means a light showing an unbroken light over an arc of<br>the horizon of 360 degrees.</p><p><br><strong>FLASHING LIGHT</strong><br>&apos;FLASHING LIGHT&#x2019; means a light flashing at regular intervals at a frequency<br>of 120 flashes or more per minute.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hydrogen/LNG as a marine fuel]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As the utilization of fossil resources gets to be increasingly limited there&apos;s a requirement for alternative fuels moreover at the ocean.

For short sea distance travel purposes, batteries may be an arrangement. In any case, for longer distances, when there&apos;s no possibility of energizing at the ocean, batteries don&apos;t have sufficient capacity, however. A few ventures have illustrated the utilize of compressed hydrogen (CH2 ) as a fuel for road transport<br><br><strong>Hydrogen and LNG a helping hand to achieve IMO goals of Decarbonization</strong><br>Within the ABS Future Fuels LinkedIn Survey, 47% of the respondents said LNG as the arrangement to the 2050 emissions target whereas 40% chose hydrogen. Moreover, the survey concluded that Hydrogen and LNG as fuels could help the shipping industry meet IMO decarbonization goals. LNG can diminish greenhouse gas (GHG) emanations by roughly 20%. Bio-methane can be carbon neutral whereas hydrogen could be a zero-carbon fuel.<br><br><strong>Will these conquer the future shipping industry?</strong><br>The later cost spikes in oil and gas costs have moreover implied that, elective sources of fuel are presently much more unmistakable than they were. Discourses on methanol, alkali, and hydrogen are presently immovably built up. All it has taken could be a widespread and gigantic cost spike to truly get individuals considering future fuels. As a result, motor producers are active in creating the fundamental propulsion frameworks to empower these modern powers to be utilized as bunkers. These modern plans not only incorporate alternative fuels, but use hybrid frameworks with the most propulsion frameworks and battery packs utilized in parallel.<br><br><strong>What flaws keep their way perilous?</strong><br>Hydrogen and natural gas are both non-toxic, colourless, and scentless gasses. Due to the little molecular size of hydrogen, it is more troublesome to seal associations and valves for spillages in an LH2 framework besides, the LH2 temperature at atmospheric pressure is 90 &#x25E6;C lower than LNG. In an LH2 framework, handling hardware will be subjected to expansive temperature varieties. The temperature of materials may alter from &#x2212;253 &#x25E6;C to surrounding temperature, giving a temperature difference (&#x2206;T) of around 270 &#x25E6;C. In an LNG framework, the comparable &#x2206;T is around 180 &#x25E6;C. As a result of the temperature changes, material contraction and expansion may lead to weakness and leakages. Additionally, hydrogen is highly reactive, which can lead to degradation of the fabric and subsequently leakage. Hydrogen embrittlement can decrease the malleable quality, ductility, break sturdiness, and split conduct of metals.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maritime Technology and Innovation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It has been traditionally perceived that the maritime industry, compared to other industries, is less permeable to innovation, where only explicitly defined strategy with centralized and guided managerial leadership would spark some innovative activities.

Around 90% of world trade is carried by the international<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;shipping industry. Without ships and the transportation services these ships<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;provide, the world would not be as prosperous as it is today and many<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;countries would not be able to participate in world trade. As the world&#x2019;s<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;population proceeds to develop, especially in developing nations, low-cost<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;and productive oceanic transport has a fundamental part to play in the<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;development and sustainable development. Shipping makes a difference<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;and guarantees that the benefits of exchange and commerce are more<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;equally spread. No nation is completely self-sufficient, and each nation<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;depends on sea exchange to offer what it has and purchase what it needs.<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;Much of what we utilize and consume in our regular lives either has been or<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;will be transported by ocean, within the frame of crude materials,<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;components, or wrapped up articles.<br><br><strong>Shipping and History of Exchange</strong><br>The history of exchange can be partitioned into three stages. The primary<br>began within the Mediterranean, spreading west through Greece, Rome<br>and Venice, to Antwerp, Amsterdam, and London. Amid this stage, a<br>worldwide exchange network steadily created between the three incredible<br>population centers in China, India, and Europe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>First, this exchange was by land and was slow and costly, but when the<br>voyages of revelation opened up worldwide ocean courses within the late<br>fifteenth century, transport costs fell significantly and trade volumes<br>escalated. The moment stage was activated by the industrial revolution<br>within the late eighteenth century. Developments in ship design,<br>shipbuilding, and worldwide communications made it conceivable for<br>shipping to be conducted as a worldwide industry, at first through the Baltic<br>Trade, while reliable steamships and specialized developments such as the<br>Suez Canal made it conceivable for liner companies to function as standard<br>administrations.</p><p><br><strong>Advancements in Shipping and World Trade</strong><br>A few 11 billion tons of merchandise are transported by ship each year. This speaks to an impressive 1.5 tons per individual based on the current worldwide population. Shipping&#x2019;s capacity to exchange products and materials from where they are produced to where they will be eventually consumed supports modern life.<br><br> &#xA0; &#xA0; For a financial region such as the European Union, shipping accounts for 80% of total exports and imports by volume, and a few 50% by value. As of 2019, the overall esteem of the yearly world shipping exchange had come to more than 14 trillion US Dollars.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Digitalisation in Maritime Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The whole world is drifting towards digitalization at a rapid pace.

The dotcom boom in the 2000s to the COVID pandemic, we&apos;ve seen only an uptrend in the shift to the dominion of computational systems in every industry. The Maritime industry is never behind. In fact, it was one of the first to embrace the changes around. For instance, the industry was the first to adopt Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards back in the 1980s. And the scene is no different today. The industry is taking long strides in the new niche.</p><p><br> &#xA0; &#xA0;&#x201C;Digitalisation definitely isn&apos;t an entirely new concept to shipping, it&#x2019;s been happening for 20-30 years in specific areas that needed greater efficiency&quot;, says Mark Warner, Senior Director, Inmarsat Maritime. Maritime industry had to deal with compelling and immediate problems as it controlled the major portion of global trades. Efficiency and reliability was always maintained to cope up with the rising demands. Thus, the industry always stood at the forefront in the digitalisation wave.</p><p><br> &#xA0; &#xA0;The shipbuilding industry always ran to adapt to the evolution of novel designing methods with the use of CAD softwares, thus making the process more efficient and innovative resulting in unprecedented modeling. Plus, many different software manufacturers have been incorporating their own utilities into the system and portfolios creating a system of systems that cover the entire end-to-end product life cycle. The different systems had their own ecosystem and their unification was done through interfaces, which led to a heterogeneity of data and products, with a significantly high cost and very low efficiency.</p><p><br> &#xA0; &#xA0;One of the pillars of Industry 4.0 is the connectivity of the systems. Therefore the natural evolution of the systems used in shipbuilding must be towards a single and completely integrated platform, that we can call a digital platform. For this platform to be efficient, it must be supported by the 3D model and product data. Therefore, the core of the platform must be the system that is capable of giving birth, evolving and developing the model, as long as it is in a single location. CAD systems, such as FORAN, AVEVA, Catia, etc. are so powerful &#xA0;that they are &#xA0;capable of integrating into a single database, geometric design and product attributes that can be at the core of digital platforms. This can enable the marine industry to enter the 4.0 revolution. To that end AI and ML can help a lot, the &#xA0;advent of which is paving way to revolutionize the industry in ways never thought of. It packs in the potential for radical designing and experimentation through simulation. Analyzing the so hyped Big Data in the industry hopefully live upto the dreams enabling much innovations in the field.<br> &#xA0; &#xA0;In a nutshell, merging the elements of Data Science through digitalisation with the long evolved shipbuilding industry techniques has great potential ahead that can change the industry from grassroot level.<br></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
